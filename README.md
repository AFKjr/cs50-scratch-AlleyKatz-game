A game I made using Scratch for the Harvard CS50 course - AlleyKatz

My CS50 Scratch program - play the game here: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1242362915/

## Description:
AlleyKatz is a game inspired by the underground bike messenger and fixed gear bike community. Alleycat racing 
is (un) sanctioned racing using fixed-gear bikes. Riders rely on speed, navigation, and street smarts.

## About Alleycat Racing
Alleycat races are informal bicycle races that mimic the work of bike messengers. Riders receive a manifest of checkpoints and must navigate city streets to complete deliveries as quickly as possible.

## Game Features

- Parallax scrolling backgrounds for speed effect
- Collision detection with obstacles
- Scoring system based on distance traveled. 

## AlleyKatz Demonstrates

- Implementing parallax scrolling in Scratch
- Managing game state and collision detection
- Using custom variables and blocks
- Uses custom sprites (four unique sprites)
- Several unique scripts were written for each sprite
- Uses conditionals, loops, and a variable
- Keeping score (custom variable)
